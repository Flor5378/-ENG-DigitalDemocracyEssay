# Digital Democracy & U.S. Immigration Policy  
### ICE, Palantir, and the Datafication of Human Rights Abuses

This project analyzes how the collaboration between **ICE** (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and **Palantir Technologies** contributes to a growing system of **digital surveillance** targeting undocumented migrants in the United States.  

We explore how tools such as facial recognition, geolocation tracking, data aggregation systems, and the new **ImmigrationOS** platform may violate key principles of **privacy**, **personal data protection**, and **digital democracy**.

### Key Points
- Since 2025, ICE has intensified data-driven immigration enforcement.  
- Palantir provides technologies for mass data collection, analysis, and tracking.  
- These practices raise concerns of **digital authoritarianism** and possible **data colonialism**.  
- Legal frameworks such as the **Privacy Act of 1974** appear insufficient to prevent abuses.  
- Testimonies, reports (Amnesty International, media), and political reactions indicate escalating risks to civil liberties.

### Objective
To evaluate whether the Trump administration’s strengthened use of digital tools—through ICE and private companies—threatens **privacy rights**, **data protection**, and democratic principles in the United States.
